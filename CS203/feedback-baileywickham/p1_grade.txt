***************  Grading Notes  ***************


********************  Grade Calculation  ***************


Class Action
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        executeAction, executeActivityAction, executeAnimationAction
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        These relate directly to what an Action does.
    Methods you put here:
        executeAction, executeActivityAction, executeAnimationAction
        -> For this group, you got 6.0 out of 6.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        moveToFull, moveToNotFull, moveToOreBlob
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        See what's done in the implementation.  An entity's state is being
        changed.
    Methods you put here:
        moveToFull, moveToNotFull, moveToOreBlob
        -> For this group, you got 4.0 out of 4.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        createActivityAction, createAnimationAction
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        These metods are creating these actions *for* and Entity, which is quite
        tightly coupled to the responsibility of an Entity.
    Methods you explained well, even though they weren't in a preferred place:
        createActivityAction (in class WorldModel)
        createAnimationAction (in class WorldModel)

        -> For this group, you got 2.0 out of 2.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        scheduleActions
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        See the implementation.  This has a lot of logic related to the Entity
        type, making that preferred.  It is doing scheduling, but it's doing
        that by invoking another method.
    Methods you put here:
        scheduleActions
        -> For this group, you got 3.0 out of 3.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        createBlacksmith, createMinerFull, createMinerNotFull, createObstacle,
                createOre, createOreBlob, createQuake, createVein
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        Entity is best here, since it is creating kinds of
        entities.  Since there are a number of them, grouping under Entity
        is logical.  In the future, we may have a better solution than 
        just static methods, but in this assignment you were just asked
        to move methods.
    Methods you put here:
        createBlacksmith, createMinerFull, createMinerNotFull, createObstacle,
        createOre, createOreBlob, createQuake, createVein
        -> For this group, you got 5.0 out of 5.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        executeMinerFullActivity, executeMinerNotFullActivity,
                executeOreActivity, executeOreBlobActivity,
                executeQuakeActivity, executeVeinActivity
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        Entity is preferred -- see what these methods are doing, and think 
        about encapsulation.  Activity isn't unreasonable, but if you put it
        in activity, you should have something in your document saying what
        your thought process was, and mentioning the possibility of Entity.
    Methods you put in an OK class:
        executeMinerFullActivity, executeMinerNotFullActivity,
        executeOreActivity, executeOreBlobActivity, executeQuakeActivity,
        executeVeinActivity
        -> For this group, you got 5.0 out of 5.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        getAnimationPeriod
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        This is purely getting a parameter of an Entity.
    Methods you put here:
        getAnimationPeriod
        -> For this group, you got 3.0 out of 3.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        getCurrentTile, nextImage
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        Entity is best here, because they relate to the screen representation
        for the entity.  See the function body.
    Methods you put here:
        getCurrentTile, nextImage
        -> For this group, you got 5.0 out of 5.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        nextPositionMiner, nextPositionOreBlob
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        See what these methods are doing, and where they're called.
        It's dealing with the position of the entity
        in the world, and determining that entity's next position.
    Methods you put here:
        nextPositionMiner, nextPositionOreBlob
        -> For this group, you got 3.0 out of 3.0

Class Entity
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        transformFull, transformNotFull
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        Entity really is the best place here, because this is using a lot of
        internal information about what entities are, and how they behave.
    Methods you put here:
        transformFull, transformNotFull
        -> For this group, you got 2.0 out of 2.0

Class EventSchedule
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        processEvents, removePendingEvent, scheduleEvent, unscheduleAllEvents
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        You weren't asked to change EventSchedule
    Methods you put here:
        processEvents, scheduleEvent, unscheduleAllEvents
        -> For this group, you got 0.0 out of 0.0

Class Point
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        adjacent, distanceSquared
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        Things related to distances between points are a natural thing for
        a Point to know how to do.  These are only used in relation to at
        least one Entity, though, so they could reasonably be part of Entity,
        too.
    Methods you put here:
        adjacent, distanceSquared
        -> For this group, you got 2.0 out of 2.0

Class VirtualWorld
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        addInitial, createInitialEntities, loadEntityImages, loadImages,
                runSimulation, scheduleInitialActions, setup, setupBackground
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        You weren't asked to move methods from VirtualWorld.
    Methods you put here:
        addInitial, createInitialEntities, loadEntityImages, loadImages,
        runSimulation, scheduleInitialActions, setup, setupBackground
        -> For this group, you got 7.0 out of 7.0

Class WorldModel
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        paint
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        This is painting the contents of the WorldModel to the screen.
    Methods you explained well, even though they weren't in a preferred place:
        paint (in class VirtualWorld)

        -> For this group, you got 2.0 out of 2.0

Class WorldModel
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        addEntity, getOccupant, getOccupantCell, isOccupied, removeEntity,
                removeEntityAt, setOccupantCell, withinBounds
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        These relate directly to WorldModel data structures.
    Methods you put here:
        addEntity, getOccupant, getOccupantCell, isOccupied, removeEntity,
        removeEntityAt, setOccupantCell, withinBounds
        -> For this group, you got 7.0 out of 7.0

Class WorldModel
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        nearestEntity
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        This is only used by findNearest, and can be made private by putting
        it here.
    Methods you put here:
        nearestEntity
        -> For this group, you got 1.0 out of 1.0

Class WorldModel
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        findNearest, findOpenAround
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        These are looking for stuff inside the world.  That's a pretty direct
        relationship to world.  It might be tempting to put it in Entity, 
        but it's looking for an entity in world, so there's no instance of 
        Entity we can attach this method to.
    Methods you put here:
        findNearest, findOpenAround
        -> For this group, you got 2.0 out of 2.0

Class WorldModel
    Group of methods that belong here:  
        moveEntity
    This method group's home(s) was chosen because:
        This is operating on an WorldModel.  Entity, in this case, is just
        the thing contained within the WorldModel.  See, for example,
        moveEntity.  It is changing the position of the entity, but check 
        out what it's doing to the WorldModel -- setOccupancyCell is doing
        some pretty involved things, deeply related to WorldModel.
    Methods you put here:
        moveEntity
        -> For this group, you got 1.0 out of 1.0

***************  Unidentified Methods  ***************

I found the following methods in your yEd UML file, but I couldn't
find them in the scoring rubric.  There's no penalty for this; perhaps
you're just looking ahead to some methods you'll add in the future,
or maybe it's something the grader just isn't checking.
However, maybe some of these are a typo, which might have prevented you
from getting credit for them.  Take a look, and if the problem truly is
a typo, you can consider resubmitting.  Please check to see if you'd actually
get credit if the typo were fixed, though!

I couldn't find:
    equals in point
    execute in event
    getbackground in worldmodel
    getentities in worldmodel
    getsize in worldmodel
    gettarget in event
    gettime in event
    hashcode in point
    main in main
    nulltest in testcases
    runtests in testcases
    runtestsandexit in main
    setbackground in worldmodel
    tostring in point
    usage in main
    worldmodel in worldmodel
