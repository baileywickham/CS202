********************************************

MISSED (5.0 points):  You implemented a PriorityQueue that is ordered by time
MISSED (3.0 points):  
        	For moving entities, you implemented nextPosition() in the
        	common superclass by adding an abstract method to determine if
        	the path is blocked by another entity
GOOD (3.0 points):  
        	For miner, you made one or more abstract methods so that most of the
        	duplicate code in transform() was lifted to the miner superclass


    Run result:  Overall behavior is significantly incorrect
    Run score (30 points):  60.0%


Final score:  78.00
