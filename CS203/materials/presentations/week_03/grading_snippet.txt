***************  Unidentified Methods  ***************

I found the following methods in your yEd UML file, but I couldn't
find them in the scoring rubric.  There's no penalty for this; perhaps
you're just looking ahead to some methods you'll add in the future,
or maybe it's something the grader just isn't checking.
However, maybe some of these are a typo, which might have prevented you
from getting credit for them.  Take a look, and if the problem truly is
a typo, you can consider resubmitting.  Please check to see if you'd actually
get credit if the typo were fixed, though!

I couldn't find:
    equals in point
    hashcode in point
    main in main
    nulltest in testcases
    runtests in testcases
    runtestsandexit in main
    tostring in point
    usage in main
    worldmodel in worldmodel
