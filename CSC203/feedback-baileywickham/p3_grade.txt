**************************************************

MISSED (5.0 points):  Animation supertype has at least two subtypes (hopefully
        for entity and the daylight animation).
MISSED (8.0 points):  Action has two subtypes (hopefully for activities and animations)
GOOD (3.0 points):  The animation interface isn't implemented by VirtualWorld or WorldModel.
        It's better to create a new class for this:  Consider the
        single responsibility principle here.

GOOD (5.0 points):  Animation supertype has at least two subtypes (hopefully

GOOD (8.0 points):  Action has two subtypes (hopefully for activities and animations)
MISSED (3.0 points):  The animation interface isn't implemented by VirtualWorld or WorldModel.
        It's better to create a new class for this:  Consider the
        single responsibility principle here.
GOOD (9.0 points):  An animation test was implemented by having three subtypes of
        animatable
GOOD (10.0 points):  Entity implements an interface (hopefully a supertype for things that are animatable)
GOOD (10.0 points):  Action is an interface
GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.blacksmithTiles is static
GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.blacksmithTiles is final
GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.blobTiles is static
GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.blobTiles is final

GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.veinTiles is final
GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.minerFullTiles is static
GOOD (0.5 points):  VirtualWorld.minerFullTiles is final
GOOD (5.0 points):  The lists in the VirtualWorld.xxxTiles fields are immutable
    Run score (22 points):  100%
GOOD (4.0 points):  You correctly stored the grass tile in a data member,
        so that you could put the daylight animation over just
        the grass.  It was tempting to instead test some property
        of the tile, like its character representation, but this
        would't be good design. What if some other tile in the future
        uses the same character?  You'd be setting youself a trap for
        the future if you were to do it this way.


Final score:  84.00
