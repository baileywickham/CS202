 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 </div>
<p>
In this lab you will create a virtual drawing workspace on which
you can place various geometric shapes. You will not actually be drawing
the shapes in this program; you will simply be representing geometric
shapes as objects placing them in a "workspace" data structure that represents a
location in a 2D space. The
workspace will make use of a <code>java.util.List</code> from the 
Java Standard Library to store shapes.  It will have methods that allow 
you to add, remove, and inspect
the shapes it contains. All of the shapes share a common set of methods
defined by a Java interface. The implementation of these common methods varies,
as appropriate, by shape. In addition, each shape has one or more methods
unique to it. The following shapes will be supported: circle, rectangle,
triangle, and convex polygon.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
</div>

<ul>
<li><p>To develop and demonstrate basic object-oriented development skills. Much of the 
   structure of the solution is given - use good judgment when "filling in the blanks".</p></li>
<li><p>To become familiar with Java interfaces and the concept of polymorphism.</p></li>
<li><p>To practice using the <code>instanceof</code> operator.</p></li>
<li><p>More practice using existing classes and interfaces from the Java Standard Library, such as: 
   <code>List</code>, <code>ArrayList</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>, and 
   <code>Color</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="header">
<h2>Given Files</h2>
</div>

<p>
In this lab, the only provided files are the Main class, a very simple
Point class and a starter
set of test cases.  In the test cases file, the actual tests are commented
out.  That is to say, the code of the tests are made into a big multi-line
comment, starting with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>.  You'll
want to progressively remove test methods from within the comments, as you
write more of the lab.
</p>

<p>
The given file is a <i>starter</i> test file for your code.  Be sure 
to add to this file to make sure your code is working properly.  The
autograder will use a much more extensive test file.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Ground Rules</h2>
</div>

<p>
Many of the classes and interfaces you will be writing in
this lab have counterparts in the Java Standard Library. You <b><i>may
not</i></b> use the Java Standard Library versions in your implementation
unless explicitly instructed to do so (see below). The Java Standard Library classes
and interfaces you may use are identified by a complete package
specification. For example, you will be using the <code>java.awt.Color</code>,
<code>java.util.List</code> and <code>java.util.ArrayList</code> 
types from the 
Java Standard Library. You may also use the <code>java.lang.Math</code> class from the Java Standard
Library.
Any classes or interfaces in the specifications below (other than Color,
List and ArrayList)
must be entirely written by you. If you have any questions
regarding this restriction please be sure to ask your instructor early in the
development process.

<p>
As stated above, your classes and interfaces will use many classes that already exist in the Java Standard Library.  
For example, to use the <code>Color</code> classes, you will need to import 
<code>java.awt.Color</code>.
<p>It might be possible to re-use some of your code from Lab 3, but it will need
to be reused but will need to be re-written to match this specification.
<div class="header">
<h2>Task</h2>
</div>

<p>
You must define the <code>Shape</code> interface and implement the <code>Circle</code>, 
<code>Rectangle</code>, <code>ConvexPolygon</code>, <code>Triangle</code>, and 
<code>Workspace</code> classes as described below. The instance variables 
for each class
are not explicity specified. Remember, an instance variable makes every object 
of a class require more memory.  All instance variables should be needed
to represent the state of an object, or it should provide a significant 
computational efficiency or reduction in code complexity.  On the other hand,
local variables declared in the method in which they are used are inexpensive,
and should be used freely.
<i>Be ready to justify your choices!</i> Make sure all your instance 
variables are private, so that you maintain encapsulation.

<p>
You may add helper methods other than the methods specified below, but the 
additional methods must be private.

<ol>
   <li>
   Define a Java interface <code>Shape</code> with the following methods. (Note that the
   input parameters for each method, if any, are intentionally not shown. You must figure
   out what is needed):
   <ul>
      <li><code>Color getColor()</code> - Returns the <code>java.awt.Color</code> of
      the <code>Shape</code>.</li>
      <li><code>void setColor()</code> - Sets the <code>java.awt.Color</code> of the <code>Shape</code>.</li>
      <li><code>double getArea()</code> - Returns the area of the <code>Shape</code></li>
      <li><code>double getPerimeter()</code> - Returns the perimeter of the <code>Shape</code></li>
      <li><code>void translate()</code> - Translates the entire shape by moving
          it by a given delta-x and delta-y, given as double parameters
	  in that order.  In a right-handed coordinate system, a positive
	  delta-x moves to the right, and a positive delta-y moves up.
   </ul>
   </li>


   <li>
   <p>
   Define a Java class <code>Circle</code> that implements the <code>Shape</code> interface. Circles have a radius,
   a center, and a <code>Color</code>.  In addition to implementing the required methods specified by the <code>Shape</code> 
   interface you must also implement the following methods. (Again, note that the input parameters for each method, 
   if any, are intentionally not shown):
   <ul>
      <li><code>Circle()</code> - A constructor with parameters to initialize 
      the radius, center and color, in that order.  Do not 
      implement a zero-argument constructor.</li>
      <li><code>double getRadius()</code> - Returns the radius of the <code>Circle</code>.</li>
      <li><code>void setRadius()</code> - Sets the radius of the <code>Circle</code></li>
      <li><code>Point getCenter()</code> - Returns the center of the <code>Circle</code></li>
   </ul>
   </br>Note: Use the constant <code>Math.PI</code> when performing any calculations involving PI.
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Define a Java class <code>Rectangle</code> that implements 
   the <code>Shape</code> interface. Rectangles have a 
   width, a height, a Point indicating the top left corner, and 
   a <code>java.awt.Color</code>.  
   In addition to implementing 
   the required methods specified by the <code>Shape</code> interface you 
   must also implement the following methods. 
   (Again, note that the input parameters for each method, if any, are intentionally not shown):
   <ul>
      <li><code>Rectangle()</code> - A constructor with parameters for
      the width, the height, a Point representing the top-left corner,
      and a <code>java.awt.Color</code>, in that order.
      Do not 
      implement a zero-argument constructor.</li>
      <li><code>double getWidth()</code> - Returns the width of the <code>Rectangle</code>.</li>
      <li><code>void setWidth()</code> - Sets the width of the <code>Rectangle</code></li>
      <li><code>double getHeight()</code> - Returns the height of the <code>Rectangle</code>.</li>
      <li><code>void setHeight()</code> - Sets the height of the <code>Rectangle</code></li>
      <li><code>Point getTopLeft()</code> - Returns the <code>Point</code> representing the top left corner 
      of the <code>Rectangle</code></li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Define a Java class <code>Triangle</code> that implements the <code>Shape</code> interface. Triangles have three 
   Points indicating its vertices and a <code>Color</code>.  To simplify your solution, the vertices will always be 
   given in counter-clockwise order.  However, there are calculations for the area of a Triangle that will work with 
   the vertices in any order. In addition to implementing the required methods specified by the 
   <code>Shape</code> interface you must also implement the following methods. (Again, note that the input parameters 
   for each method, if any, are intentionally not shown):
   <ul>
      <li><code>Triangle()</code> - A constructor with parameters giving
      each vertex as a <code>Point</code>, and a <code>java.awt.Color</code>,
      in that order.  The first <code>Point</code> passed to the constructor will be vertex A, the 
      second <code>Point</code> vertex B, and so on.</li>
      <li><code>Point getVertexA()</code> - Returns the Point representing vertex A of the <code>Triangle</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Point getVertexB()</code> - Returns the Point representing vertex B of the <code>Triangle</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Point getVertexC()</code> - Returns the Point representing vertex C of the <code>Triangle</code>.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Define a Java class <code>ConvexPolygon</code> that implements the <code>Shape</code> interface. A ConvexPolygon 
   must a java <code>Point</code> array (not an <code>ArrayList</code>) indicating its vertices and a <code>Color</code>.  
   Assume the Points in the <code>Point</code> array will always be given in counter-clockwise order.  In addition 
   to implementing the required methods specified by the <code>Shape</code> interface you must also implement the 
   following methods. (Again, note that the input parameters for each method, if any, are intentionally not shown):
   <ul>
      <li><code>ConvexPolygon()</code> - A constructor taking a Java
      <code>Point[]</code> and a <code>java.awt.Color</code>, in that
      order.
     Do not 
      implement a zero-argument constructor.</li>
      <li><code>Point getVertex()</code> - Takes an index and returns the specified vertex of the <code>ConvexPolygon</code>.  It should throw an exception
      if the index is not legal
      <li><code>int getNumVertices()</code> - gives the number of vertices
   </ul>
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Define a Java class <code>WorkSpace</code> to hold <code>Shape</code> objects. The <code>WorkSpace</code> class
   shold have <i>one private instance variable</i> of type <code>List&lt;Shape&gt;</code> to hold <code>Shape</code> objects.  
   You may choose which kind of <code>List</code> you use. The <code>WorkSpace</code> class should have the following 
   public methods. (<i>Note that this time the parameters <b>are</b> specified!</i>):
   <ul>
      <li><code>WorkSpace()</code> - A zero-argument constructor to initialize its instance variable to an empty List. 
      The constructor should not take any parameters.  (If you do nothing in this constructor, you may omit it from your code altogether.)</li>
      <li><code>void add(Shape shape)</code> - Adds an object which implements the <code>Shape</code> interface to the end of the <code>List</code>
      in the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Shape get(int index)</code> - Returns the specified <code>Shape</code> from the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>int size()</code> - Returns the number of <code>Shapes</code> contained by the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>List&lt;Circle&gt; getCircles()</code> - Returns a <code>List</code> of all the <code>Circle</code> objects contained 
      by the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>List&lt;Rectangle&gt; getRectangles()</code> - Returns a <code>List</code> of all the <code>Rectangle</code> objects contained 
      by the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>List&lt;Triangle&gt; getTriangles()</code> - Returns a <code>List</code> of all the <code>Triangle</code> objects contained 
      by the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>List&lt;ConvexPolygon&gt; getConvexPolygons()</code> - Returns a <code>List</code> of all the <code>ConvexPolygon</code> 
      objects contained 
      by the <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>List&lt;Shape&gt; getShapesByColor(Color color)</code> - Returns a <code>List</code> of all the <code>Shape</code> 
      objects contained 
      by the <code>WorkSpace</code> that match the specified <code>Color</code>.</li>
      <li><code>double getAreaOfAllShapes()</code> - Returns the sum of the areas of all the <code>Shapes</code> contained by the 
      <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
      <li><code>double getPerimeterOfAllShapes()</code> - Returns the sum of the perimeters of all the <code>Shapes</code> contained by the 
      <code>WorkSpace</code>.</li>
   </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
   Use the <code>instanceof</code> operator in the appropriate places of your solution.
   </p>
   </li>
</ol>

<h3>Suggestions</h3>
</div>
<p>
The following suggestions might be helpful:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Write the <code>Shape</code> interface first.</p></li>
   <li><p>After creating the <code>Shape</code> interface, write one class at a time that implements the interface. Test and debug
   until you are satisfied with its design, implementation, and functionality.  Then move on to the next class.</p></li>
   <li><p>Implement the <code>WorkSpace</code> class last, and develop it incrementally, testing as you go.  Notice that many of the methods are similar and differ only by the 
   <code>Shape</code> type that they work with.</p></li>
   <li>The given <code>TestCases</code> tests the signatures
   of each of your classes.  As you implement classes, remove the
   comment characters to run the tests.
      
      <li><p><a href="http://www.mathwords.com/a/area_convex_polygon.htm">Mathwords</a> is a good reference for the area of a convex polygon.</p></li>

</ul>
<div class="header">

<h2>Testing</h2>

</div>

<p>
You are given a starting test file to help you write your tests.  It includes some
tests for Circle, WorkSpace, and your implemenation specifics. This file is a good 
place to find some of the expected method parameters if you are stuck.  You are 
expected to add to this test file to thoroughly test all of your code! 
</p>


<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your code in <code>turninXXX/lab04</code> to GitHub by midnight on the due date.  
If you'd like to submit the lab one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>lab04</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the lab two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>lab04</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check you submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't compile your lab for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the lab.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 lab04</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
