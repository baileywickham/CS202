<p>
This lab explores <em>streams</em> through the implementation of a program to 
read in and transform a set of points, where each point is represented by
an x, y and z value.  These points can be drawn to form an image.  The initial
set of points includes a lot of "noise" - random points that obscure
the image.  Through implementing various 
computational operations on these points they are
transformed into a more interesting image.
</p><p>
Streams are a useful tool to process collections. In particular, they allow
operations to be carried out in parallel, e.g. on a multi-core computer.  
We don't need to do that here because our data set is small, but it's a
valuable technique to learn.  Streams can be used even in situations where
parallel processing is not desirable.
</p><p>
A Java stream lets you operate on a
collection of data using a sequence of commands and/or operations.
You can read more about them here: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html
</a>.

 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li><p>To gain familiarity with the streams API
<li><p>To use stream operations including filter, map and collect.
</ul>


<div class="header">
<h2>Setup</h2>
</div>
<p>
The given code contains a program to read in the file
<code>positions.txt</code> and create a PNG file called
<code>transformed.png</code>.  It then attempts to create a GUI
that displays the image.
<p>
This data that is read represents a large number of 
points in space with
an x, y and z value.  You are to implement a method called
<code>transformPoints()</code>.
<p>
For your reference, to start with the point file should look like this:
<p>

<h2>Stream API</h2>
</div>

After you have confirmed that you can read and process the points,
work through the following operations <em>using streams</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remove all points that have a z value > 2.0.
<li><p>Scale down all the points by 0.5
<li><p>Translate all the points by {-150, -37}
</ul>
Be sure that you use <code>collect, filter, map</code> to complete 
these tasks.  <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#toList--">Collectors.toList()</a>
might come in handy.<p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your code in <code>turninXXX/lab10/</code> to GitHub by midnight on the due date.  
If you'd like to submit the lab one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>lab10</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the lab two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>lab10</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
Please don't submit <code>doc_files</code> or the instructions.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check you submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't compile your lab for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the lab.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 lab10</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
