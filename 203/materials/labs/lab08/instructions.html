  <div class="header">  <h1>Lab 8, CSC 203 - depth first search</h1></div>
<p>
This lab explores a recursive algorighm:  a depth-first
search on a two-dimensional grid.  This depth-first
search is a simple "pathing" algorithm, in that it can be used to
calculate a path from one point on the grid to another, while avoiding
obstacles.
</p>

 <div class="header">
 <h2>Objectives</h2>
 </div>
 
<ul>
<li>To implement depth first search
<li>Think about trajectory planning on a 2D grid structure
<li>Create a test framework that can be used for the class project,
    when it addresses pathing.
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
<p>
Begin with the base code.  Note that this code represents the world as 
a 2D grid.  As is normally the case in computer graphics, the program
uses a 2D coordinate system where {0, 0} is the upper left corner.
This means that as the y value of a coordinate increases, the point is 
<em>lower</em> on the screen. The following image shows the general 
structure:<br>

<p>
The project we have been working with this quarter
is using a similar data structure.  This lab's code is a much simpler
version of a virutal world.
<p>
Test to make sure the base code works for you.  When your program starts 
in graphical mode, it should look something like this.  The eventual goal 
is for the wyvern to find a valid path to 
the water, traversing only the grass and not 
the rock obstacles:

If you're using the text version, your screen should look like this:

<h2>Getting started - Background</h2>
</div>
<p>
This program uses the same <a href="https://spritely.jovial.com/">Spritely</a>
library as the class project.  It takes advantage of the fact that
Spritely allows you display graphics whenever you want in your code,
rather than having a main animation loop as is more typical with graphics
programming.  Because of this, a recursive algorithm can be implemented
directly, using recursive method calls, and still use animation to show you
its progress.
<p>
Open the provided Java file and read through the code.  You will
adapt this code to the project in an assignment.  The code creates
a grid data structure, where it stores the state of each square.
It then creates a <code>SpriteWindow</code> from the spritely library;
this window does the actual display.  Then, in the <code>run()</code>
method, it calls <code>searchForPath()</code> to look for the water.  The
current version only looks to the right, and gives up if it hits an
obstacle.
<p>
<code>Main</code> also has an option to run unit tests.  You'll see that
the unit tests create simpler words, and apply the same algorithm.  You
should test your algorithm on a variety of layouts that are more challenging
than the one provided.  You might need to change existing tests, once
your algorithm does a better job of finding the water.
<p>
This program uses both the 
<a href="https://spritely.jovial.com">Spritey</a> and
<a href="https://testy.jovial.com">Testy</a> libraries.

<h2>Step 1</h2>
</div>

Implement a depth first search.  You 
can visit the neighboring nodes in whichever order you like.  Perhaps you
can try visiting in various orders, and ultimately select an ordering 
that clearly illustrates that the search runs into the obstacles at 
some point.  In other words, don't pick directions that result in never
visiting a grid cell that is occupied by an obstacle.
</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Step 2</h2>
</div>

<p>
After the search completes, make sure that the code in place to 
display the path.  Be sure to think about how cells are being 
added to path, and how the path is represented.
In the below example image with a slightly modified layout, all the 
cells with a yellow square have 
been visited but are not a part of the current path, and the grid cells 
that make up the current path are shown with red.  You have been provided
with images for both, in the images directory.
<p>
<center><img src="html_images/path.png" width="70%"></center>
<p>
For avoidance of doubt, when you are finished, the wyverin should always
find the water with the default
layout.  Make sure that you display a frame of animation for every
change to the grid.  That is, don't collapse more than one change into
a single animation frame.

<div class="header">
<h2>Submission</h2>
</div>

<p>
Submit your code in <code>turninXXX/lab08</code> to GitHub by midnight on the due date.  
If you'd like to submit the lab one day late with a penalty of 5%, 
add a file called <code>late_5_percent_off.txt</code> to the 
<code>lab08</code> directory.  If you'd like to submit the lab two 
days late with a penalty of 15%, add a file called
<code>late_15_percent_off.txt</code> to the <code>lab08</code>
directory.  Make sure you add and push the late file.
<p>
Please don't submit <code>doc_files</code> or the instructions.
<p>
After your code is working and submitted,
check you submission using the <code>checkgit</code> command on the
unix server.  If the autograder can't compile your lab for a reason that
is caught by <code>checkgit</code>, you will get a zero on the lab.  To
check your submission, on a Unix server type:
<blockquote><pre>checkgit &lt;git-login> 203 lab08</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If it works, you will see the message "** Tests Passed **".  If not,
you will see some kind of error message.  The error message might not tell
you exactly what you need to change, but it should give an indication as
to what is wrong.
