        SOME USEFUL UNIX COMMANDS
        =========================

ls    ll     ls -ls
        Get a directory listing

cd dir     cd ..    cd ~
        Change directory (to "dir", to the current directory's parent, to
        your home directory)

pico foo.java
        Run the pico editor on the file foo.java

vi foo.java
        Run the vi editor on foo.java.  vim is a popular implementation of vi.
        vi has a steep learning curve, but it's available everywhere, and probably
        will continue to be for a very long time.

grep some_string *.java
        Search for 'some_string" in all java files in the current directory.
  	"grep -I" to ignore cases (upper case vs. lower case)

rm foo
        Remove a file named foo

mkdir dir
        Create the directory dir

rmdir dir
        Remove the directory dir

checkgit <git loging name> 203 <assignment name> [-dir tmp]
	Locally-created command to check your repository.  Run it without
	any arguments for a help message.  "-dir" is useful to see the
	version of your repository the grader will consider for your
	assignment.

chmod +x run.sh   Makes the file run.sh "runnable".  You might need to do
                  this if you copy run.sh and the other given files using
                  some sort of graphical interface.  Note that a shell
		  script, like run.sh, can also be destroyed if you
		  check it out on Windows, and copy it to a Unix
		  system.  Instead, clone the repo on the Unix system.
